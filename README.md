# Getting Started with message-board-app

#1 Download the project zip from github

#2 Open the project in VS code

#3 Open the terminal or command prompt

#4 go to the project path directory in your terminal or command prompt

#5 Open the terminal or command prompt

#6 Run command 'json-server --watch db.json --port 5000' to start the mock json api

### `json-server --watch db.json --port 5000`

#7 Run command 'npm start' to start the application on default port 3000. HashRouter used in project. Hence url will be http://localhost:3000/#/

### `npm start`

#8 if there is an error running script run command 'npm install react-scripts --save'

### `npm install react-scripts --save`

#9 For test run command 'npm run test'

### `npm run test`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
